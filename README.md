# fast_txt_img_writer
notepad +image. +.py pack-save.

I used notepad for work-record, but no more!

ctrl+c image or imgfile and ctrl+v to paste.
use the paint for notation.

ctrl+b to crop screenshot directly. very fast.

type"[]" and ctrl+f entire python code, it will dump to txtfilename_hrminsec.py


saves img with txt, and loads.
it saves png. no even load gif.

===============

NOTE: click "create" button before use.. to create dir, which holds txts,imgs.
dirname can be changed. like project name.
