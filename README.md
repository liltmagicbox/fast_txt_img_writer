# fast_txt_img_writer
notepad +image. +.py pack-save.

I used notepad for work-record, but no more!

ctrl+c image or imgfile and ctrl+v to paste.
use the paint for draw notation.
*avove 80% was just crop the screenshot.

ctrl+b to crop screenshot directly. very fast.
* before I was: press prtscr, open paint, ctrl+v, click cropbutton, crop, ctrl+c. nomore!

type"[]" and ctrl+f entire python code, it will dump to txtfilename_{hr}{min}{sec}.py
*crop screenshot, and freeze python code, very easy to reproduce.

saves img with txt, and loads.
it saves png. no even load gif.

if the file not saved yet(or changed), occurs isit ok msg.

===============

NOTE: click "create" button before use.. to create dir, which holds txts,imgs.
dirname can be changed. like project name.
